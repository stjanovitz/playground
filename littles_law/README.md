Test of Little's Law 
====================
This is a simulation of an M/M/1 queue that supports [Little's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law).

As the number of service completions increases, the throughput of the system reaches the mean
inter-arrival rate (3.75 customers per minute) of the system. Additionally, as the number of service
completions increases, the arrival rate (which the throughput matches) times the average system
response time approaches the average number of people in the systems. This can be seen in the
decreasing difference between the two quantities in the simulation output.
